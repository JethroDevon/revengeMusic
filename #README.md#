# revengeMusic



Written in c++

A command line music program for linux,
Designed not to play two tracks at once and to be easily used in shell programs, this way key shortcuts and option flags
could allow a user to find a creative uses, I intend to release a gui mode and sound file search and create a music program with
similar implementation to rofi.

Dependencies:

At the moment this program requires a link to FMOD music library in order to play .mp3 encoding
however I aim to implement another sound library, FMOD requires a subscription and makes installing
this program very difficult.
